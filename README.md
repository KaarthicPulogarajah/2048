# 2048
Play 2048!

This is the classic game of 2048, where the objective is to join similar tiles to combine the values together, and reach the goal of 2048.
The tiles can be controlled through the WASD buttons, and ALL tiles move in the same direction on each turn. 
Combining tiles reduces the number of occupied spaces, and a random tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears each turn.
